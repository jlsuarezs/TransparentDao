#### ðŸš¨ Everything in this repo is highly experimental software.
It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted. It can result in irreversible loss of funds.

#### ðŸ‘‹ We are tagging tasks that are [good first issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) so you can get started contributing to Aragon Core.
Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. Everyone will be specially nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!
