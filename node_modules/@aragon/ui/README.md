## What is it?

Aragon UI is a React library used to build user interfaces for Aragon and its related projects. It provides the components needed to build experiences that feel integrated with Aragon ecosystem, and can be used both client or server side.

Used by:

- [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/aragon)
- [Aragon apps by the core team](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps)
- [aragon.one](https://aragon.one/)
- [hack.aragon.org](https://hack.aragon.org/)

## Getting Started

Install it from npm:

```sh
npm install --save @aragon/ui
```

Aragon UI require some assets (e.g. fonts) in order to work properly. These need to be copied where they can be accessed by the library, like the `public/` directory of a project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-assets-outside-of-the-module-system).

To copy these assets, use the `copy-aragon-ui-assets` command provided by Aragon UI:

```sh
npx copy-aragon-ui-assets ./public
```

This emplacement has to be communicated to the library using `<AragonApp>`, so that the assets can be accessed by the components down the tree.

```jsx
import { AragonApp } from '@aragon/ui'

const App = () => (
  <AragonApp publicUrl="/aragon-ui-assets/">
    <h1>Hello AragonÂ UI</h1>
  </AragonApp>
)
```

*Your project is now ready to use Aragon UI. ðŸ’«*

Open https://ui.aragon.one/ for a list of the available components and how to use them.

### Assets Synchronization (optional)

You may also want to add it as a step in your project scripts, so that upgrading AragonÂ UI can be done without having to worry about these.

```json
"scripts": {
  "sync-assets": "copy-aragon-ui-assets ./public",
  "build": "npm run sync-assets && react-scripts build",
  "start": "npm run sync-assets && react-scripts start"
}
```

See `copy-aragon-ui-assets -h` for more information.
