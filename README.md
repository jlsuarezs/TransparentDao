# [WIP] TransparentDao

This Dao is meant to be added to [aragon-apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) after it is finished.

The Dao forwards calls to functions from the IncomeStatement, CashflowStatement and BalanceSheet in order to log its financial data in real time.

The **js** directory hosts Javascript code used to analyze the Dao from a fundamental analysis standpoint. It's basically accounting code that can help traditional investors evaluate a Dao (through Intrinsic Value, Return on Equity, Price to Book Ratio etc)
